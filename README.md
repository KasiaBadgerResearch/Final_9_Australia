# How has the balance between Australia’s merchandise imports from high-income economies and from low- and middle-income economies in East Asia & Pacific evolved between 1960 and 2020?

## Abstract

Using World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI), this study examines the evolution of Australia’s merchandise import composition from 1960 to 2020. At the beginning of the period, imports from high-income economies accounted for almost 100% of total merchandise imports, while imports from low- and middle-income economies in East Asia & Pacific were effectively 0%. Over six decades, these shares converged to roughly 50–50, reflecting the rise of regional industrial economies, diversification of trade partners, and structural shifts in global supply chains. Both indicators exhibited year-to-year fluctuations and temporary reversals, demonstrating that the transition was dynamic rather than smooth. These findings highlight the multidimensional and nonlinear nature of trade evolution, emphasizing that Australia’s shift from high-income-dominated imports to a more balanced sourcing profile was gradual, uneven, and influenced by both long-term economic transformations and short-term shocks.

## 1. Question

How has the balance between Australia’s merchandise imports from high-income economies and from low- and middle-income economies in East Asia & Pacific evolved between 1960 and 2020?

- **High-income imports**: Merchandise imports from high-income economies (% of total merchandise imports)
- **Low- and middle-income imports**: Merchandise imports from low- and middle-income economies in East Asia & Pacific (% of total merchandise imports)

## 2. Data

- **Source**: World Bank World Development Indicators (WDI)
- **Indicators**:
  - Merchandise imports from high-income economies (% of total merchandise imports)
  - Merchandise imports from low- and middle-income economies in East Asia & Pacific (% of total merchandise imports)
- **Coverage**: Australia, 1960–2020
- **Notes**: National-level data only

## 3. Method

1. Filtered dataset for Australia.
2. **Selected relevant columns**: Year, Indicator Name, Value.
3. Pivoted indicators into separate columns and sorted by year.
4. Produced a line graph comparing high-income imports and low- & middle-income imports over time.

(Analysis is descriptive; no causal inference applied.)

## 4. Results

- **High-income imports (% of total)**: Declined steadily from nearly 100% in 1960 to roughly 50% by 2020.
- **Low- and middle-income imports (% of total)**: Increased from near 0% in 1960 to roughly 50% by 2020.
- **Comparison**: The two indicators show a clear inverse relationship, with significant year-to-year fluctuations and temporary reversals within the overall convergence trend.

(Table 1. Pivoted dataset)

## 5. Interpretation

- Australia’s import profile transitioned from near-total reliance on high-income economies to a balanced structure incorporating low- and middle-income economies in East Asia & Pacific.
- The long-term convergence reflects structural economic changes, including the rise of regional manufacturing hubs, shifts in global comparative advantage, and diversification of trade partners.
- Short-term fluctuations indicate the influence of economic cycles, commodity price shocks, and trade policy adjustments.
- Overall, these trends demonstrate that international trade evolution is nonlinear and multidimensional, requiring careful consideration of both structural and temporal factors.

## 6. Limitations

- Only two indicators analyzed; other trade dimensions (e.g., services, FDI, intra-firm trade) not captured.
- National-level data may mask regional or sectoral variations in import composition.
- Descriptive analysis only; no causal mechanisms were formally tested.

## 7. Next Steps / Extensions

- Examine sector-specific import trends to determine which industries drove the convergence.
- Incorporate additional regions and income groups to contextualize Australia’s trade evolution globally.
- Apply econometric methods to test whether shifts in high-income vs low- & middle-income imports were systematically associated with global economic or policy shocks.
- Compare Australia’s import evolution with other OECD or Asia-Pacific countries to identify broader patterns of trade diversification and globalization.
